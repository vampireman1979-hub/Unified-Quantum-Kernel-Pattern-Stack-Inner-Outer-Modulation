# Unified-Quantum-Kernel-Pattern-Stack-Inner-Outer-Modulation
A deterministic five‑qubit quantum kernel architecture that unifies a multi‑phase Pattern Stack engine with a structured Inner–Outer Modulation layer. This system models layered propagation, echo dynamics, and thermodynamically scaled transformations suitable for hybrid quantum–classical workflows.
